I must warn you… this book is ATROCIOUS!

The cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak.

Even some of the order are in the wrong words.

It is the worst of the worst, so don’t say I didn’t warn you…

Our story begins with an atrocious King, 

None of his laws ever made any sense.

“Tuesday?” he laughed, “There is no such day, and I’ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.”

From that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday.

His daughter was an atrocious Princess.

She was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day.

She never brushed her hair. 

She smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious.

She even set traps throughout this story.  

One day the Princess went missing. 

In her place there was a note that read:

“I’ve  taken the Princess.

You me catch never will.”

After reading the note twice to understand it, the King commanded the greatest hero in the land to find his daughter. 

The greatest hero in the land happened to be an atrocious hero.
